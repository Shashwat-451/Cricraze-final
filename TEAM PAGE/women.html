                <h2>POOONAM YADAV</h2>
            </center>
            <p>The leg spinner from Uttar Pradesh is a vital cog in India’s wheel. Captain Mithali Raj banks on her to
                curb the flow of runs and even uses her in the initial overs if the opposition gets off to a quick
                start.The pace at which she bowls further complicates things, as the ball never seems to arrive at all.
                If you don't use your feet well and don't have quick hands, it's next to impossible to score off Poonam.
