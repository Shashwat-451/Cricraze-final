        <h2>VIRAT KOHLI</h2>
      </center>
      <p>Virat Kohli had a dream. A dream like every other young kid in India to represent the country in the
        gentleman’s game. It is this vigor and fervor for the game of cricket that has helped this extremely talented
        young boy from Delhi to scale great heights at a very young age. He was barely in his teens when he led the
        India Under-19 team to a World Cup victory in Kuala Lumpur in 2008 which was a pointer of bigger and better
        things to come in the future. After that famous victory, it was not long before he made his entry into the
        senior team and Kohli was soon brushing shoulders with the best in the business and his cricketing idol Sachin
        Tendulkar. The stylish right-handed batsman banked on the opportunities at disposal and displayed a tremendous
        sense of maturity as if to show he belonged. He was termed brash and aggressive for being expressive on and off
        the field, but Kohli imbibed all of those qualities in his gameplay only to become better with each passing
        game. He began chasing totals for India with ridiculous ease and India had found a stable batsman in the middle
        order for the long run.</p>

        <h2>ROHIT SHARMA</h2>
      </center>
      <p>Popularly known as the Hitman for his hard hitting skills, Rohit Sharma is a gifted batsman and an immensely
        talented cricketer who is pleasing on the eye with his elegance and ability to time the ball. Each time Rohit
        Sharma walks out to bat, the word “talent” features more often than not amongst his fans and the cricketing
        circles. Rohit Sharma got off to a good start in his international career with crucial contributions in the T20
        World Cup in 2007 and the CB Series in Australia. He almost made his Test debut in 2010 against South Africa but
        he injured himself on the morning of the Test match; Rohit would then have to wait for three more years to
        finally represent India in whites. Rohit continued to take giant strides in the shortest format of the game and
        attracted a lot of attention by achieving success in the IPL. He also led the Mumbai Indians to their maiden IPL
        title in 2013. His inconsistency for the national side though saw him in and out of the Indian team until he got
        a chance to feature in India's tour of the Caribbean in 2011.Rohit proved to be a revelation there and bagged
        the Man-of-the-series award.</p>

        <h2>JASPRIT BUMRAH</h2>
      </center>
      <p>MS Dhoni called him the ‘find of the tour’ after the bilateral T20I series against Australia that India won
        3-0. For long, India had struggled to find a bowler who could be effective in the death overs. Dhoni's long
        search finally ended when Bumrah answered his calls with his ability to bowl yorkers. While the yorker is his
        most potent weapon, Bumrah's unorthodox action makes it very difficult for batsmen to read him. If the IPL is
        all about spotting Indian talent and giving them the platform, the credit for Bumrah's rapid rise must go to
        Mumbai Indians. It was John Wright, who spotted him in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and drafted him into the
        squad. Bumrah has shown improvement in every edition and the presence of Lasith Malinga has been an added
        advantage. The Sri Lankan star has backed his strength and boosted his confidence. The master of yorkers has
        passed on his experience and the young Bumrah has benefited immensely.While the yorker is his
        most potent weapon, Bumrah's unorthodox action makes it very difficult for batsmen to read him.He is the best
        find of
        of the Indian team in recent decade.</p>

        </center>
        <p>R Ashwin shot to limelight after an impressive season for the Chennai Super Kings in the India Premier League
          in 2010. His ability to thrive on crunch situations and bowl with variety caught the eye of the selectors who
          saw in him a potential to be India’s lead spinner in the future. Though Ashwin started off his career as a
          top-order batsman for Tamil Nadu, he bagged wickets at will in the domestic circuit. He donned the Indian
          jersey in 2010 and dumbfounded the best in the business with his skill and variations with the ball. Often
          known to add something new to his armory and experiment with his bowling, Ashwin later came up with the carrom
          ball; avariation that was initiated by Ajantha Mendis of Sri Lanka; a variation he tried to master while
          bowling at the nets. Through the years Ashwin has been India's key spinner in Tests and ODIs at home with a
          remarkable amount of success. He impressed one and all with impressive showings against West Indies and
          Australia at home wherein he showcased his batting prowess as well.</p>

        <p>He was termed as “The Rockstar” by Shane Warne when Ravindra Jadeja took the Indian Premier League by storm
          in 2008 with his all-round heroics. An eccentric fielder, a more than handy left-arm spinner and a fearless
          batsman, Jadeja had all the qualities of a utility cricketer. Though predominantly known for his performances
          for the Rajasthan Royals in the IPL, not many notice his efforts in the longer format of the game. The
          left-handed batsman has three triple centuries to his name with a first-class average close to 50. He paved
          his way to the national side amassing 739 runs and 42 wickets in the 2008-09 Ranji season. He made his ODI
          debut in 2009 against Sri Lanka and has been a key player in the Indian since.It took him three more years
          after his ODI debut to make it into the Test side and India now see him as a good variety in the bowling
          attack and more than a handy bat lower down the order. International cricket aside, Jadeja has also been a
          vital cog in the wheel for his IPL franchise - Chennai Super Kings. </p>

        </center>
        <p>One often relates adjectives like principles, dedication, hardwork and patience to one of India’s batting
          mainstays - Rahul Dravid. After Dravid hung up his boots, these words found a new meaning in Cheteshwar
          Pujara, someone who went through the rigours of domestic cricket scoring mammoth individual scores on the flat
          tracks of Rajkot and Saurasthra. When Pujara scored a ton, he wouldn’t stop there; he would take a fresh guard
          after his milestone and concentrate on every ball to convert his hundreds into daddy hundreds. Even before he
          made his Test debut in 2010 against Australia, Pujara had already scored a triple century and a couple of
          double centuries. His first-class career was exceptional with 26 centuries and over 8000 runs with an average
          of more than 60. Such was his caliber as a batsman that the expectations from him were huge even before he
          took his initial steps in international cricket. On his Test debut, he scored a vital 72 in the second innings
          against Australia in Bengaluru when India were chasing 207. </p>

          <h2>A RAHANE</h2>
        </center>
        <p>Ajinkya Rahane is an example of a batsman from the traditional mould with a typical script of a Mumbai lad
          with a dream of making it big in the game of cricket. Like most Mumbai boys, Rahane too had a unique love for
          cricket and the childhood dream of representing the country one day. He belongs to the list of already famous
          Mumbai batsmen who were prolific in the domestic circuit and represented the country at some point of time.
          Discipline and dedication are two features one would associate Rahane with, the two qualities that every
          sportsman needs to excel in sport. Season after season Rahane did all that he could - score and score big;
          with a view to catch the right eyeballs. His dream to don the Indian jersey finally came true in India's tour
          to England in 2011 wherein he scored a half century in five ODI innings. He showed confidence and promise in
          that tour and was given an olive branch to be a part of the Indian batting line-up in the series to follow.
          Rahane's temperament was gifted with a Test call-up in 2013 against Australia and the middle-order batsman
          replied in kind with gutsy knocks overseas.</p>

        <p>Behind the earring, the famous twirled moustache and those intricately inked biceps, is a very soft-spoken
          man – Shikhar Dhawan. From a simple cricket-loving youngster going through the grind of domestic cricket to
          taking the cricketing world by frenzy by scoring the fastest century on Test debut, Dhawan has come a long
          way. The road to success has not been easy for the left-handed batsman from Delhi as he toiled his way in the
          domestic circuit year after year only to receive a Test call-up in his ninth year of first-class cricket. The
          opening batsman scored in plenty but those only made for good reading for the men in love with numbers. India
          had a stable opening combination in Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir and Dhawan had to wait for his chance
          to breakthrough in the big league. When he did get his chance, he grabbed the opportunity with both hands.
          Such was his dominance in his approach on his Test debut that Dhawan became the talk of the town after
          treating the Aussie bowlers with utter disdain. He smashed 187 off 174 balls which changed the course of the
          game </p>

          of India's squad in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup and made his first-class debut later that year. He has never
          been one of those cricketers who has set the stage on fire or has been the talk of the town for his batting
          skills. Rahul has taken gentle strides over the years and made a name for himself for being a consistent
          performer in the domestic circles. He enjoyed a breakthrough 2013-14 season, laying the foundation for
          Karnataka's Ranji Trophy victory with 1033 runs, which included three centuries, three nineties, and a
          Man-of-the-Match performance in the final. Not surprisingly, Rahul attracted a lot of bids in the IPL player
          auctions and ended up with the Sunrisers Hyderabad in the 2014 season. He has received much praise from some
          of the legends of the game namely Rahul Dravid. His consistent performances in India's A tour of Australia and
          the 2014-15 domestic season earned him a Test call up for India's tour of Australia.He can also do
          wicketkeeping
          which makes him a crucial asset.</p>

          performances in domestic cricket, Shami slowly made his way into the international team in 2013 when he made
          his ODI debut. His ability to reverse swing the old white ball made him an indispensable asset in the
          limited-overs format. He made a mark in 2015 World Cup held in Australia by taking 17 wickets and ending up as
          one of the highest wicket-takers in the tournament. It was later revealed that he played the World Cup through
          a knee injury. Shami then made his debut in the red ball cricket against West Indies in a home series and in
          the two-match series; he to took 11 wickets. In the summer that followed in England, Shami and Bhuvneshwar
          Kumar, recorded the second-highest 10th wicket partnership for India in Tests, when they put on 111 runs
          against England in Nottingham.When in form he can be the most lethal bowler of the unit in terms of pace.</p>

        <p>At a time when there was a dearth of genuine fast bowlers in India, Ishant Sharma was like a breath of fresh
          air as he burst into the limelight with his sharp pace and accurate bowling. You turn back the pages of
          cricketing history and one would have enduring memories of the lanky bowler making look batting miserable for
          Ricky Ponting. His seven-over spell in the second innings of the Perth Test of 2008 is one of his most talked
          about spells by an Indian bowler as an Australian legend had been trumped by a youngster playing just his
          fourth Test. Ishant's honeymoon period in Australia continued as he helped India win the last ever annual
          Tri-series ODI competition down under baggin the most wickets for the visitors. But since his initial success,
          Ishant has struggled to make a sustained impact because of injury woes. Yet, whenever he has been brought back
          into the Indian Test side, his contributions have been steady. The 2010 series against Australia and New
          Zealand in 2010 at home is a case in point. His ability to generate bounce from his height makes him a vital
          asset. </p>

        <p>At a tender age, Rishabh Pant has gone through all the highs and lows of a cricketing career. A promising
          talent from Delhi, Pant came into the lime-light after his batting heroics for India Under-19 in the 2016
          WorldCup. A dashing left-handed wicket-keeper batsman, he lit up the tournament with a glitzy 24-ball 75, the
          fastest half-century of the tournament, against Nepal and followed it up with a century against Namibia.
          Incidentally, his century came on the same day when he was bought by Delhi Daredevils for INR 1.9 crores from
          a base price of Rs 10 lakhs. A year after making his Ranji Trophy debut at the age of 18 in 2015, Pant broke
          records by scoring a triple-hundred against Maharashtra and a blistering 48-ball hundred against Jharkhand in
          the 2016-17 first-class season. In January 2017, he was rewarded with a call-up to India's T20 squad for the
          three home matches against England.Pant is not a finished product by any stretch of the imagination but he has
          all the raw materials in him to excel at the International level.When in form he can be dangerous. </p>

          <p>Agile behind the wickets and a batsman who believes in playing freely, Wriddhiman Saha burst into the
            cricketing scene when he scored a century in his Ranji Trophy debut. He is amongst the brightest hopes from
            the state of Bengal who is looked at as someone with immense potential. His breakthrough in international
            cricket was accidental. He was drafted in the Indian side as a specialist batsman replacing Rohit Sharma who
            injured himself on the morning of the Test match against South Africa in 2010. He made a fighting 36 in the
            second innings of that Test but that was not worthy enough for Saha to be a regular in the Indian line-up.
            He then played a Test for India two year later against Australia at Adelaide scoring a patient 35 giving
            Virat Kohli company and helped him score his maiden Test century. Saha however was a revelation in the IPL
            for the Kings XI Punjab scoring the way he liked and at a brisk pace. He is now a vital cog in the Kings XI
            batting line-up and has earned himself a reputation of scoring runs at will.</p>

            close to 140 kmph. The son of a coal miner, Umesh Yadav took to the game only at the age of 19. Blessed with
            an innate ability to bowl fast, he soon made his debut for Vidharbha in 2008 and found himself bowling to
            some of the big names in Indian cricket on the Ranji circuit. He made his international debut in 2009 for a
            tri series in Zimbabwe. He did not have the best of starts to his career, but the need for speed and want
            for a quick bowler kept him in fray for national selection. He later had a reasonable ODI home series in
            England but he impressed the most when he was picked in the Test side for a series against West Indies. His
            ability to swing the ball both ways at a lethal pace earned him a place in the India squad for the Australia
            series and in an otherwise dismal series for India, was the few plus points for India picking up 14 wickets
            in four games. However, injuries and inconsistency kept him out of the India squad </p>

          <p>Bhuvneshwar Kumar belongs to that breed of bowlers who can swing the ball prodigiously both ways at a

            but that has never been an area of concern for him as he realizes his limitations as a bowler and believes
            in focussing on his skill set rather than pace. He is often compared to his fellow UP seamer Praveen Kumar
            who hogged the limelight for swinging the ball considerably beating the best in the business during his hay
            days. Representing Uttar Pradesh in the domestic circuit, Bhuvneshwar Kumar was known for his smart
            cricketing brain and being a captain's go-to bowler. His efforts reaped benefits as he made his ODI debut in
            2012 against Pakistan.Kumar impressed everyone as he got a wicket in his very first ball of his first over
            in ODIs sending Mohammad Hafeez back to the pavilion with an outstanding in-swinger. Kumar later ended up
            with figures of 2/27 in nine overs with an economy of three.</p>

          <p>An aggressive quick bowler, who can swing the ball away from the right-handers even while hitting the pitch
            hard, Shardul Thakur has established himself as the spearhead of Mumbai's attack. With the new ball,
            Thakur's at-the-batsman method forms a neat counterpoint to Dhawal Kulkarni's more metronomic style, and the
            two combined brilliantly to win Mumbai their 41st Ranji Trophy title in February 2016. Thakur picked up
            eight wickets in the final against Saurashtra, and his dismissal of Cheteshwar Pujara on the third day, the
            ball rearing up from a length to hit the shoulder of the bat, was perhaps the ball of the match. Thakur
            hails from Palghar, a town 87 km north of Mumbai, and spent his early cricketing years lugging his kitbag on
            early-morning trains into the city. Mumbai won the Ranji Trophy in his debut season of 2012-13, but he did
            not play a major role in the triumph, picking up only four wickets in four matches at an average of 82. Told
            to lose weight by his Mumbai team-mates, Thakur came back leaner and fitter the next season, and picked up
            27 wickets at 26.25.</p>

          </center>
          <p>After plundering runs in the domestic cricket for Karnataka and for India ‘A’, Mayank Agarwal made his
            India debut during the third Test against Australia in Melbourne in December 2018. The right-hander did not
            waste any time making an impression, scoring 76 in his first innings in the international cricket. Such has
            been his performances with the bat over the last one year that he was picked in the 2019 ICC's Test Team of
            the Year.n the 2014-15 season, Mayank got plagued with fitness issues as the management was clearly not
            happy with his physique. The result was more focus on training and this in turn apparently helped him up his
            mental game as well. Trim and in shape,Mayank seemed confident than ever before but it required a
            career-changing season from somewhere to spike his path forward.That happened in the 2017-18 Ranji Season
            when he simply went berserk, plundering over a 1000 runs and went on to top the run charts.t was a
            phenomenal transition to his red-ball game and needless to say, the confidence oozed into the white-ball
            tournaments where he was already on the rise. </p>

            </center>
            <p>That Kuldeep Yadav took up spin bowling after harbouring fast bowling ambitions as a kid is well known.
              Ever since he turned into a chinaman bowler – a rather rare commodity – life has changed for the 19-year
              old. From bowling to the local boys at the nets in a silent corner in Kanpur to brushing shoulders with
              the best in the business in the Indian dressing room, Kuldeep has come a long way. Right since his U-19
              days, Yadav has shown a lot of promise with his variations with the ball. He boasts of bamboozling Sachin
              Tendulkar in one of the net sessions when he was part of the Mumbai Indians setup. Yadav then moved to
              kolkata Knight Riders harbouring hopes of a game in the IPL but it was only in the Champions League T20
              that he got his chance to prove a point.Yadav was economical and played perfect foil to Sunil Narine
              earning him praise from the cricketing circuit. He was included in India's ODI squad for the series
              against West Indies in October 2014 but didn't get a game there. He made his first-class debut that year
              in the Duleep Trophy representing Central Zone </p>

            <p>As a set of new generation bowlers took over the mantle of taking Delhi forward, the emergence of Navdeep
              Saini, the right-arm medium bowler, helped the team achieve great heights during the 2017-18 domestic home
              season. Riding high on his 34 wickets, Delhi reached the Ranji Trophy final, where they were upstaged by
              Vidarbha.Hailing from Karnal, Saini is a deceptive pacer, who relies more on swing and accuracy rather
              then pace.
              As a result of his superlative performances throughout the domestic season, Saini was the epicenter of a
              bidding war between various franchises and his services were finally won by Royal Challengers Bangalore
              (RCB) for a whopping Rupees Three crores.Tall, fast and sharp. Navdeep Saini has been a welcome addition
              to India’s pace-bowling arsenal. The right-arm pacer made it to the Indian side on the back of solid
              showings for Delhi. Saini made a memorable debut, winning a Man of the Mach award following his
              three-wicket haul against West Indies in August 2019.As a set of new generation bowlers.</p>

            <p>The right-arm swing bowler made his India debut in July 2018 following his impressive showings for
              Rajasthan and in the Indian Premier League (IPL). Chahar, who began his journey in international cricket
              with a T201 international, became the first Indian bowler (in men's cricket) to take a T20I hat-trick in
              November 2019. Chahar returned with the figures of 6/7 in that match against Bangladesh and this
              performance helped him win ICC's 2019 T201 Performance of the Year award.Rejection at 16, prodigy at 18
              and oblivion at 24. It has been the story of Deepak Chahar so far. Back in 2008, when Greg Chappell was
              the director of the Rajasthan Cricket Academy, he had snubbed Deepak's abilities as a young fast bowler.
              Then he came storming into recognition by picking up 8 wickets in his debut innings and thus routing
              Hyderabad for 21, the lowest ever total in Indian domestic cricket.However, the wings to his career have
              never attained full flight as he has been plagued by persistent injuries. Add to that his woes with the
              old ball.</p>

              including a triumphant run in the ICC Under 19 World Cup in 2018, and in the domestic cricket for Punjab.
              The stylish right-hander made his India debut in January 2019 in Hamilton.A right-hand top-order batsman
              from Punjab, Shubman Gill is known for his penchant for big runs and was hence drafted into India Under-19
              side as the vice-captain for the 2018 World Cup. He made his first-class debut before that, for Punjab in
              the Ranji Trophy in late 2017 with a half-century in the game and an attacking 129 in the next match.A
              constant feature in Rahul Dravid's plans for the Under-19 World Cup, Gill constantly played at an
              age-group level above his. In 2014, he smacked 351 in Punjab's Inter-District Under-16 tournament, and
              shared a record opening stand of 587 with Nirmal Singh.He emerged as the best batsman on both sides during
              a 2-0 victory over West Indies in 2019, with 289 runs in four innings. At the end of that series, </p>

            <p>Hanuma Vihari earned his India call-up on the back of some stellar performances for India ‘A’ and in the
              domestic cricket. The right-handed batsman, who can also double up as an occasional off-spinner, made his
              India debut during the England series in September in 2018 after averaging nearly 60 in First Class
              cricket. In his seven-match old Test career so far, he has scored three fifties, a hundred and have picked
              up five wickets.A classically correct middle-order batsman, Hanuma Vihari is proof that runs in domestic
              cricket matters. He made his debut for India at 24, by which time he was averaging nearly 60 in
              first-class cricket and it was the knowledge of what it takes to score big runs that helped Vihari become
              a first-choice pick within months of his introduction to Test cricket.Some of that was hard to see when he
              made his debut against England at The Oval in 2018. He could have been out for a duck had Stuart Broad
              decided to use DRS but he didn't and Vihari put that nervy start behind him to compile a half-century in
              his first Test innings.</p>

              season.A native of Anand, he earned his maiden IPL contract with the Mumbai Indians ahead of IPL 2013. He
              scored 369 runs in seven matches and picked up 29 wickets for Gujarat during the 2013-14 Ranji Trophy
              season. Owing to his good show in the domestic circuit and a zeal to excel in the international stage,
              Patel was later drafted in by Kings XI Punjab ahead of the 2014 edition of IPL. After displaying his
              prowess with the bat and the ball for Kings XI Punjab, Patel earned his maiden ODI call up the same year
              in a 3-match ODI series against Bangladesh.Axar Patel played just one first-class game in his debut season
              for Gujarat, but had a more successful showing in 2013. Slotted primarily as a bowling allrounder, the
              left-arm spinner got his first IPL contract with Mumbai Indians ahead of IPL 2013, although he was on the
              bench for the entire season.However, the Mumbai franchise did not give him many matches and he went into
              the auction pool for the 2014 edition of the IPL. It indeed was a blessing in disguise for the leggie.</p>

            <p>It is not easy for a spinner to find success in the shorter formats of the game where batsmen have the
              license to smash the ball around. The leg spinner is not afraid to flight the ball and has troubled many
              of the world's best with his guile. After his successful stints with the RCB, Chahal was picked for
              India's tour to Zimbabwe in 2016 and made his ODI and T201 debuts. A year later, he bamboozled the English
              line-up in Bengaluru. He became the first bowler from India to pick six wickets in a T201 and just the
              second after Ajantha Mendis (twice), to achieve the feat. With eight wickets in the series, he picked up
              both Man of the Match and Man of the Series awards.Born in Haryana, Yuzvendra Chahal is a fine right-arm
              leg-spinner, who made his first-class debut at the age of 19 in an away game against Madhya Pradesh at
              Indore. Though he has not played many first-class games, he has been impressive in the shortest format and
              it also earned him an IPL contract with Mumbai Indians in 2011.However, the Mumbai franchise did not give

            <p>Mohammed Siraj's rise as a seamer was remarkably swift. The son of an autorickshaw driver in Hyderabad,
              he only began playing the game in class seven. It was in 2015 that he first bowled with a cricket ball. In
              2017, he bagged an IPL contract worth INR 2.6 crore. Months later, he was wearing an India shirt and
              bowling in a T20 international against New Zealand.Sturdy and athletic, Siraj has a deceptive run-up,
              which initially suggests that a left-arm bowler is steaming in. He is, however, a right-armer and by his
              own admission is a natural at getting the ball to swing into the right-hander. He has always been able to
              bowl a pretty quick bouncer though, something that had impressed his captain David Warner and team mentor
              VVS Laxman in the Sunrisers Hyderabad set-up. Potential translated to performance when he was his state's
              highest wicket-taker playing only his second season of Ranji Trophy - 41 wickets in nine matches. He was
              subsequently picked to play for the Rest of India and was brought on board by the India A team as well for
              a tour of South Africa in July-August 2017.The step up to the big league arrived soon after.</p>
