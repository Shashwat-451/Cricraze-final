            <div class="history_section">
                The Gabba Test was an oscillating affair of attack and counter-attack that rewarded spectators with
                arguably the most absorbing cricketing contest witnessed last year.

                <br>


                <div class="points">
                    <p>When play began on the final day, India still needed 328 to win with 10 wickets in hand. At 167
                        for 3, after the dismissal of skipper Ajinkya Rahane, Pant walked in ahead of Mayank Agarwal. A
                        boisterous Gabba began to fret as Pant’s enterprising innings brought the equation down to 69
                        off 15 overs with six wickets still standing. “This team was built on fearlessness and (players)
                        backing their abilities from any position. The guys playing deep down knew they could get across
                        the line, especially with how Rishabh was hitting the ball, and if the guys at the other end
                        supported him,” Webb, Indian team’s former strength and conditioning coach, recalls.

                </div>

                <div class="points">
                    <p>As India chipped away, Australia’s bowlers began to panic. “Rishabh is a special player who is
                        incredibly skilled, destructive and someone who backs his instincts. When we got to lunch on the
                        final day, everyone was pretty calm. I was away from the main discussions at the time; however,
                        the mood was that the team was up for the challenge. They certainly did that. I was extremely
                        happy for every single team member.”
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="points">
                    <p>Cheteshwar Pujara was the glue that kept India’s innings together on the final day, taking blow
                        after blow in an innings of 56 that consumed 211 deliveries. It gave the likes of Shubman Gill
                        (91), Washington Sundar (22) and Pant (89 not out) the freedom to flourish. “Pujara is known as
                        the brick wall for a reason. Not only for his ability to stay at the crease for long periods but
                        to endure everything thrown at him,” Webb says. “Brick walls don’t come down easily. Everyone in
                        the team knows Puji will do whatever it takes to get through tough periods for the team while
                        he’s at the crease - including taking balls on the body.”
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="points">
                    <p>India batted with a giddy sense of freedom on day five, the centrepieces being stands of 114
                        between Pujara and Gill and 61 between Pujara and Pant. It took more than three of the best fast
                        bowlers in the world to bring Pujara down. At one point, a short-of-a-length ball from Hazlewood
                        jammed the fingers of Pujara’s right hand against the bat handle. Pujara was on the ground and
                        writhing in pain. “Puji is a tough, resilient character. A man of process and focus,” Webb says.
                        “Puji focuses on a mixture of physical conditioning, strength, batting and fielding practice
                        throughout a week. Considering he wasn’t playing IPL before the Australian away series, he had
                        extended time focusing on his individual needs in his home State. The way Puji plays his game,
                        he expects to spend long periods on the field either batting, running between the wickets or in
                        the field. For the Australian Test series, we had to ensure he was physically ready to meet
                        those expectations and physical demands.” </p>
