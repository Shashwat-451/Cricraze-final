      <div class="history_section">
        It's been 14 years when India's star batsman Yuvraj Singh scripted history by slamming six sixes in a row
        against England in the first-ever T20I World Cup in 2007.
        During England pacer Stuart Broad's over, former Indian cricketer hit six towering sixes and to make the fastest
        fifty in T20I cricket. The half-century came in just 12 balls.

        <br>


        <div class="points">
          <p>Registering his name in the history books, the left-hander then became the first Indian batsman and second
            overall after South Africa's Herschelle Gibbs to achieve the feat in international cricket.
            ust before the Stuart Broad, Yuvraj had an altercation with Andrew Flintoff, which was caught in the
            on-field cameras. Yuvraj had once revealed what Flintoff had exactly.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="points">
          <p>Yuvi revealed in the 22 Yarns podcast, "I remember I hit two good boundaries off Flintoff which he
            obviously didn't like. He said something to me and I said something back. It was quite a serious fight at
            that time. The umpires also came in. I just felt like I wanted to hit every ball out of the park."
            "Luckily, the first ball I hit (off Broad) went out of the park. The second ball I hit went into the crowd.
            The third ball I hit over point, where I hadn't even hit a boundary in my career. Collingwood came and told
            Broad to keep bowling yorkers to me outside off-stump because the off-side was big.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="points">
          <p>"But Broad thought of bowling into my legs. So when he decided to do that, I knew he was in trouble. The
            fifth ball hit the toe of my bat, it was a small boundary that went over Flintoff. The sixth ball I knew he
            has to bowl a yorker. So I was ready to hit it straight and it was in my arc,” said Yuvraj.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="points">
          <p>“My first look was to Flintoff, giving him a cheeky smile. My second look was to Dimitri Mascarenhas sort
            of telling him that the scores are settled and then obviously I did a fist pump with Dhoni. It actually
            didn’t register to me that I had hit six sixes. For me, it was all about settling the scores with England,"
            he further said. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="points">
          <p>The Men in Blue were able to win the inaugural ICC T20 World Cup in 2007 and Yuvraj was a vital player for
            the team in the tournament.

            The 38-year-old was also phenomenal in India's World Cup triumph in 2011 as he became the first all-rounder
            to score over 300 runs and scalp 15 wickets in a single World Cup.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="points">
          <p>The feat included four Man of the Match awards and Man of the Tournament for 362 runs and 15 wickets.

            In 2019, Yuvraj had announced his retirement from all forms of cricket. With a career spanning over 304
            ODIs, 58 T20Is, and 40 Tests, Yuvraj cemented his place as a player who could win matches for his side
            either through his electric fielding, fierce batting, or smart bowling. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="points">
          <p>The flamboyant batsman amassed 6 sixes in Stuart Broad's over and scored his fifty of just 12 balls, which
            is still the fastest in the T20 format. In that match between India and England, the Men in Blue had won the
            toss and opted to bat first.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="points">
          <p>Yuvraj came out to bat when Robin Uthappa's wicket fell and he provided the late flourish allowing India to
            post 218 runs on the board. India went on to win the match against England by 18 runs.</p>
